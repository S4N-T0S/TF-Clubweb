## About

I'm mainly a backend developer working with C++ and Rust, so I built this to try my hand at React and frontend development. It started as a simple stats page for the OG club (an in-game club in The Finals) but grew into something bigger when I added global stats and player tracking.

## Acknowledgments

Thanks to [@leonlarsson](https://github.com/leonlarsson) for providing the historical player data which is used in the Player History Search.
